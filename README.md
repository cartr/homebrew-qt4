# homebrew-qt4

This Homebrew tap allows you to install Qt4 (and various packages that depend on it) on macOS Sierra. You can install it like this:

    brew tap cartr/qt4
    brew tap-pin cartr/qt4
    brew install qt@4

Feel free to submit an issue or pull request if you run into any problems or have any suggestions for improvements to the packages.

**Please note:** Qt4 is unsupported by its creators, so there are likely security/usability problems with it that will never be resolved. If you can, please consider migrating your projects to Qt5.
