**NOTICE:** These packages probably don't work on ARM-based Macs or more recent versions of macOS. I don't know for sure because I don't use a Mac anymore. I'm leaving this repository up to avoid breaking people's builds, but I can't do much to help you with it. (You should consider migrating your software to a newer version of Qt.)

Please let me know at carter.sande@duodecima.technology if you are interested in maintaining this project.

# homebrew-qt4

This Homebrew tap allows you to install Qt4 (and various packages that depend on it) on macOS Sierra and newer. You can install it like this:

    brew tap cartr/qt4
    brew install qt@4

Feel free to submit an issue or pull request if you run into any problems or have any suggestions for improvements to the packages.

**Please note:** Qt4 is unsupported by its creators, so there are likely security/usability problems with it that will never be resolved. If you can, please consider migrating your projects to Qt5.

## Apple Silicon / "M-series" Macs

To use this software on Macs with ARM processors, you might need to [install a separate copy of Homebrew with Rosetta emulation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64951025).
